# DOM - Document Object Model

1. Browsers does not render the raw HTML code directly. Instead, they first parse the HTML document into a tree like structure called **Document Object Model (DOM)**, and then renders it onto the webPage.

2. It represents the entire structure of the webpage, all the elements (like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc) becomes objects (also called as `nodes`) in this tree.

3. It's like a live, object based representation of our HTML document that browser understands and can interact with using JavaScript.

# DOM Manipulation

1. The DOM Manipulation involves accessing & modifying the content, structure, or style of the webpage (in DOM tree) using JavaScript.

2. JavaScript uses an inbuilt API called **DOM API** to interact with **DOM** dynamically.

3. The **DOM API** is the collection of methods and properties provided by the browser that allows JavaScript to interact with **DOM tree**.
